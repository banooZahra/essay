There are different personality models for classifying
personality traits according to the definitions of psychologists. In this paper, we focus on
the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) model and explain how a two-stage deep neural
model for personality identification can use more information from text and therefore,
have better performance in classifying input data. To this end, in the first stage, we use
capsule neural networks to extract meaningful hidden patterns from word-level semantic
representation to be used for calculating personality traits. Moreover, in the second stage,
we benefit from contextualized document-level representation
of text as well as statistical psychological features.
